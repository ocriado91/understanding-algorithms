# SalesmanProblemGA
Travelling Salesman Problem through Genetic Algorithms

## Introduction
__Genetic Algorithms (GAs)__ are computational techniques that draw inspiration
from the principles of natural selection and genetics, as famously explored
by Charles Darwin in his theory of evolution. These algorithms provide a
powerful framework for solving complex optimization problems in diverse fields
such as engineering, finance, biology, and artificial intelligence.

In this notebook, we are going to implement a solution for _Travelling Salesman
Problem_ using a basic Genetic algorithm.
